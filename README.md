Python - Wolfram|Alpha - Query service

If you are porting this service don't forget to add you own AppId at the Python file. You can get one (actually I think it's like 20 or so) from Wolfram|Alpha, for a maximum of 2000 (again, I think) queries per month.  
You can also check a live version of this service at http://rj-jesus.duckdns.org/
